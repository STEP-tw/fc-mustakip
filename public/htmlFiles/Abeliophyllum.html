          <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</b> is a
          monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It
          consists of one species, <b>Abeliophyllum distichum</b> Nakai, endemic
          to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven
          sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not
          yellow, flowers.

          It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
          opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
          above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the
          new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with
          a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.

          It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
